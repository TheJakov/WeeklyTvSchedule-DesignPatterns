# WeeklyTvSchedule-DesignPatterns

The project is a part of class called "Design Patterns" where we use various design patterns (Creational, Structural or Behavioral) within the project. Project is divided into 3 complementary tasks. The goal of the project is to read various input files (such as "TV Presenters, TV Shows, Program Schedule, Roles of TV Presenters, etc..") and create weekly TV schedule using design patterns.
